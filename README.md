# Praetorian
A bot for email-verifying new server members, before giving them access to the server. The email has to belong to a specific configurable domain.

## Invite
Basic invite link [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=835201049701646336&permissions=268520528&scope=bot)

The above link doesn't grant admin which is required for the `setup` command.

Invite link *with* admin permission [here](ttps://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=835201049701646336&permissions=8&scope=bot), is recommended for the best experience.
Admin permissions can be removed after the setup command is called as only that requires it.

## Commands
`verify`, `code`, `help`, `setup`, `configure`

Use the !help command to get an up to date explaination on these commands
